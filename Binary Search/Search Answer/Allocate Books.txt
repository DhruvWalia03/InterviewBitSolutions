Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.

College library has N bags,the ith book has A[i] number of pages.

You have to allocate books to B number of students so that maximum number of pages alloted to a student is minimum.

A book will be allocated to exactly one student.
Each student has to be allocated at least one book.
Allotment should be in contiguous order, for example: A student cannot be allocated book 1 and book 3, skipping book 2.
Calculate and return that minimum possible number.

NOTE: Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible.

Solution is below:
