Given a string A consisting of lowercase characters.
We need to tell minimum characters to be appended (insertion at end) to make the string A a palindrome.

Input 1:
 A = "abede"

Output 1:
 2

Explanation 1:
 We can make string palindrome as "abedeba" by adding ba at the end of the string.

Solution is below: 
*/

int Solution::solve(string A) {
    
    int n = A.size(),i = 0,j = n-1,cnt = 0;
    while(i<=j)
    {
        if(A[i] == A[j]) 
            i++,j--;
        else
        {
            if(j == n-1)
                cnt++,i++;
            else
                cnt += (n-1-j),j = n-1;
        }
    }
    return cnt;

}
