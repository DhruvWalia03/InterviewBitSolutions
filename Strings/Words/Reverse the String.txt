Given a string A.

Return the string A after reversing the string word by word.

NOTE:

A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.

Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces, even if it is present in the input string.

If there are multiple spaces between words, reduce them to a single space in the reversed string.

Input 1:
    A = "the sky is blue"
Output 1:
    "blue is sky the"

Solution is below:
