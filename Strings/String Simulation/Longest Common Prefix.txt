Given the array of strings A,
you need to find the longest string S which is the prefix of ALL the strings in the array.

Longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1
and S2.

For Example, longest common prefix of "abcdefgh" and "abcefgh" is "abc".

Input 1:
    A = ["abcdefgh", "aefghijk", "abcefgh"]
Output 1:
    "a"
Explanation 1:
    Longest common prefix of all the strings is "a".

Solution is below: 
*/

string Solution::longestCommonPrefix(vector<string> &A) {

    int i,n=A.size(),j,m = INT_MAX,x;
    string ans = "";
    for(auto s:A)
        x = s.length(),m = min(m,x);
    for(j=0;j<m;j++)
    {
        char c=A[0][j];
        for(i=1;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(A[i][j]!=c)
                break;
        }
        if(i==n)
            ans+=c;
        else break;
    }
    return ans;

}
