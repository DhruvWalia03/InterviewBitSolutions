int Solution::candy(vector<int> &A) {

    int i,n = A.size(),ans = n;
    vector<int> l(n,0),r(n,0);
    for(i = 1;i < n;i++)
        if(A[i] > A[i-1])
            l[i] = l[i-1]+1;

    for(i = n-2;i >= 0;i--)
        if(A[i] > A[i+1])
            r[i] = r[i+1]+1;
            
    for(i = 0; i < n;i++)
        ans += max(l[i],r[i]);
    return ans;
