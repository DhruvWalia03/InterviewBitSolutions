Problem Description
Given an integer array A of size N consisting of unique integers from 1 to N. You can swap any two integers atmost B times.
Return the largest lexicographical value array that can be created by executing atmost B swaps.

Input 1:
 A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 B = 1

Output 1:
 [4, 2, 3, 1]

Explanation 1:
 In one swap we can swap (1, 4) so that the array becomes : [4, 2, 3, 1].

Solution is below:

vector<int> Solution::solve(vector<int> &A, int B) {

    int n = A.size(),i;
    map<int,int> mp;
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
        mp[A[i]] = i;
    for(i = 0;i < n; i++)
    {
        if(A[i] != n-i && B>0)
            swap(A[mp[n-i]],A[i]),B--;
    }
    return A;
