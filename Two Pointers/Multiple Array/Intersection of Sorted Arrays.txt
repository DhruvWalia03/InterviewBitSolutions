Find the intersection of two sorted arrays.
OR in other words,
Given 2 sorted arrays, find all the elements which occur in both the arrays.
Example :
Input : 
    A : [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
    B : [3 3 5]
Output : [3 3 5]
Input : 
    A : [1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
    B : [3 5]
Output : [3 5]
 NOTE : For the purpose of this problem ( as also conveyed by the sample case ), 
 assume that elements that appear more than once in both arrays should be included multiple times in the final output.

Solution is below:
