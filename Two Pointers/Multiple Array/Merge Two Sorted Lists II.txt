Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

Note: You have to modify the array A to contain the merge of A and B. Do not output anything in your code.
TIP: C users, please malloc the result into a new array and return the result. 
If the number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively, the resulting size of array A after your code is executed should be m + n

Example :

Input : 
         A : [1 5 8]
         B : [6 9]

Modified A : [1 5 6 8 9]

Solution is below:

void Solution::merge(vector<int> &A, vector<int> &B) 
{
    int i=0,j=0,n=B.size();
    while(i < A.size() && j < n)
    {
        int x = A[i],y = B[j];
        if(x<y)
            i++;
        else
        {
            A.insert(A.begin()+i,y);
            i++;j++;
        }
    }
    while(j < n)
        A.push_back(B[j++]);
