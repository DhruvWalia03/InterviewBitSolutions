Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.
Return the sum of the three integers.

Assume that there will only be one solution

Example:
given array S = {-1 2 1 -4},
and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)

Solution is below:

int Solution::threeSumClosest(vector<int> &arr, int target) {
        
        long long d = 1e10,res = 0;

        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++)
