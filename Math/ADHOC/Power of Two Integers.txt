Given a positive integer which fits in a 32 bit signed integer, find if it can be expressed as A^P where P > 1 and A > 0. A and P both should be integers.

Solution is below: 
*/

int Solution::isPower(int A) {

    if(A == 1)
        return 1;
    for(int i=2; i<32; i++)
    {
        for(int j=2;pow(j,i)<=INT_MAX;j++)
        {
            if(pow(j,i) == A)
                return 1;
        }
    }
    return 0;

}
