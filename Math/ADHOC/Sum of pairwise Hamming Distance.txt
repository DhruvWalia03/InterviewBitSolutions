Hamming distance between two non-negative integers is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given an array A of N non-negative integers, find the sum of hamming distances of all pairs of integers in the array. Return the answer modulo 1000000007.

Solution is below:

    int i,j,n = A.size(),cnt = 0;
    long long ans = 0,mod = 1e9+7;
    for(i=0;i<=31;i++) // we have 32 bits in integers
    {
        cnt = 0;
        for(j=0;j<n;j++) // count all the elements with ith bit on and pairing them with off ith bit results one combination
        {
