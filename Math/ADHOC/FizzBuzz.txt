Fizzbuzz is one of the most basic problems in the coding interview world. Try to write a small and elegant code for this problem. 
Given a positive integer A, return an array of strings with all the integers from 1 to N.
But for multiples of 3 the array should have “Fizz” instead of the number.
For the multiples of 5, the array should have “Buzz” instead of the number.
For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, the array should have “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.

Solution is below: 
*/

vector<string> Solution::fizzBuzz(int A) {
    vector<string> ans;
    int i,j;
    for(i=1;i<=A;i++)
    {
        if(i%3==0 && i%5==0)
            ans.push_back("FizzBuzz");
        else if(i%3==0)
            ans.push_back("Fizz");
        else if(i%5==0)
            ans.push_back("Buzz");
        else ans.push_back(to_string(i));
    }
    return ans;
}
