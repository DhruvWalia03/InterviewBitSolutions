A robot is located at the top-left corner of an A x B grid (marked ‘Start’ in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked ‘Finish’ in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: A and B will be such that the resulting answer fits in a 32 bit signed integer.

Example :

Input : A = 2, B = 2
Output : 2

2 possible routes : (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (1, 1) 
              OR  : (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1)

Solution is below:

int Solution::uniquePaths(int A, int B) {
 
    int dp[A][B];
    memset(dp,0,sizeof(dp));
    for(int i=0;i<A;i++)
        dp[i][0] = 1;
    for(int i=0;i<B;i++)
        dp[0][i] = 1;
    for(int i=1;i<A;i++)
    {
        for(int j=1;j<B;j++)
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];
    }
    return dp[A-1][B-1];
}
