This Solution is By Dhruv Walia

Problem Description

Given an integer A, return the number of trailing zeroes in A!.

Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.



**Problem Constraints**
1 <= A <= 10000


Solution is below: 
*/

int Solution::trailingZeroes(int A) {
 
    int ans = 0, y = 5;
    while(A>=y)
    {
        ans += (A/y);
        y *= 5;
    }
    return ans;
}
