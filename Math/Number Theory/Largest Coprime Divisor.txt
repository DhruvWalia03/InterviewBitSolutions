You are given two positive numbers A and B. You need to find the maximum valued integer X such that:

X divides A i.e. A % X = 0
X and B are co-prime i.e. gcd(X, B) = 1

Solution is below: 
*/

int Solution::cpFact(int A, int B) {

    // maximum element that divides A is A itself
    // therefore we start checking from it till gcd(x,B) ==1

    while(__gcd(A,B) != 1)
        A /= __gcd(A,B);
    return A;
}
