Given a string, 
find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example:
The longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", which the length is 3.
For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.

Solution is below: 
*/

int Solution::lengthOfLongestSubstring(string A) {

    int i,n = A.length(),j,x,y,ans = 0;
    unordered_map<char,int> mp;
    x = 0;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        if(mp[A[i]] == 0)
            mp[A[i]] = 1;
        else
        {
            mp[A[i]] = 2;
            while(mp[A[i]] == 2 && x <= i)
            {
                mp[A[x]]--;
                x++;
            }
        }
        ans = max(ans,i-x+1);
    }
    return ans;
}
