Problem Description

Given a stream of numbers A. On arrival of each number, you need to increase its first occurence by 1 and include this in the stream.
Return the final stream of numbers.

Input 1:
 A = [1, 1]
Input 2:
 A = [1, 2]


Output 1:
 [2, 1]
Output 2:
 [1, 2]


Explanation 1:
 On arrival of the second element, the other element is increased by 1.
Explanation 2:
 No increases are to be done.

Solution is below:
