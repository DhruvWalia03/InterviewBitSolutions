Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

NOTE : The path has to end on a leaf node.
Example :

         1
        /
       2
max depth = 2.

Solution is below:
