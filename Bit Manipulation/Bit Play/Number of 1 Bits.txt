Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of 1 bits it has.

Example:

The 32-bit integer 11 has binary representation

00000000000000000000000000001011
so the function should return 3.

Note that since Java does not have unsigned int, use long for Java

Solution is below: 
*/

int Solution::numSetBits(unsigned int A) {

    int ans = 0;
    while(A>0)
    {
        ans += A%2;
        A /= 2;
    }
    return ans;
}
