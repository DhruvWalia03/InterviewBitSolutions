Implement the next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the numerically next greater permutation of numbers for a given array A of size N.

If such arrangement is not possible, it must be rearranged as the lowest possible order i.e., sorted in an ascending order.

Note:

1. The replacement must be in-place, do **not** allocate extra memory.
2. DO NOT USE LIBRARY FUNCTION FOR NEXT PERMUTATION. Use of Library functions will disqualify your submission retroactively and will give you penalty points.

Solution is below: 
*/

vector<int> Solution::nextPermutation(vector<int> &A) {
    
    int i,j,x,y,n=A.size();
    if(n == 1)
        return A;
    for(i=n-2;i>=0;i--)
    {
        if(A[i+1]>A[i])
            break;
    }
    if(i == -1){
        reverse(A.begin(),A.end());
        return A;}
    
    for(j=n-1;j>i;j--)
    {
        if(A[j]>A[i])
            break;
    }
    swap(A[j],A[i]);
    reverse(A.begin()+i+1,A.end());
    return A;
}
