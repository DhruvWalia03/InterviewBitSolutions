Given a positive integer n and a string s consisting only of letters D or I, you have to find any permutation of first n positive integer that satisfy the given input string.

D means the next number is smaller, while I means the next number is greater.

Notes

1. Length of given string s will always equal to n - 1
2. Your solution should run in linear time and space.

Solution is below:

vector<int> Solution::findPerm(const string s, int B) {
    
    int i,j,x,y,n=s.length();
    vector<int> v;
    v.push_back(1);
    if(n == 1)
        return v;
    v.clear();
    x = 1; y = n;
    for(i=n-1;i>=0;i--)
    {
        if(s[i] == 'D')
            v.push_back(x++);
        else
            v.push_back(y--);
    }
    v.push_back(y);
    reverse(v.begin(),v.end());
    return v;
