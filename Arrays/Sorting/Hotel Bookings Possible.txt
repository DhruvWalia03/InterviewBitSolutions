A hotel manager has to process N advance bookings of rooms for the next season. His hotel has K rooms. Bookings contain an arrival date and a departure date. He wants to find out whether there are enough rooms in the hotel to satisfy the demand. Write a program that solves this problem in time O(N log N) .

Input:

First list for arrival time of booking.
Second list for departure time of booking.
Third is K which denotes count of rooms.

Output:

A boolean which tells whether its possible to make a booking. 
Return 0/1 for C programs.
O -> No there are not enough rooms for N booking.
1 -> Yes there are enough rooms for N booking.
Example :

Input : 
        Arrivals :   [1 3 5]
        Departures : [2 6 8]
        K : 1

Return : False / 0 

At day = 5, there are 2 guests in the hotel. But I have only one room. 

Solution is below: 
*/

bool Solution::hotel(vector<int> &arrive, vector<int> &depart, int k) {
    
    map<int,int> mp;
    vector<int> v;
    int i,n = arrive.size(),x = 0;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        mp[arrive[i]]++;
        mp[depart[i]]--;
        v.push_back(arrive[i]);
        v.push_back(depart[i]);
    }
    sort(v.begin(),v.end());
    for(auto f:v)
    {
        x += mp[f];
        mp[f] = 0;
        if(x>k)
            return 0;
    }
    return 1;
    
}
